## ❓ What is React Initializr?
• <a href="https://0l1v3rr.github.io/react-initializr/" target="_blank">React Initializr</a> is a simple, easy-to-use, web-based, boilerplate-free project generator.  

• Generate modern <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> templates without barely touching the terminal - just fill in some input fields, add your beloved dependencies, and generate your project!  

• You can browse amongst every available npm package thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/npm/registry" target="_blank">NPM Registry API</a>.

• If you prefer to use **TypeScript** you can totally do that too, just select the `TypeScript` option before generating the project. The site will add all the necessary dependencies and files, you don't have to do anything else.  

• Share your project with others - if you're about to create a tutorial, a blog, a course, or something that requires sharing your *"starting point"* with others, just click on the **"Copy Link"** button. If anyone opens that link, they can download exactly the same project as you did. Therefore you can almost skip the "generating project" phase.  
**Example:** [https://0l1v3rr.github.io/react-initializr?name=my-project&version=1.0.0&description=This+is+my+cool+project&language=TypeScript&packages=axios%3Breact-icons%3Breact-router](https://0l1v3rr.github.io/react-initializr?name=my-project&version=1.0.0&description=This+is+my+cool+project&language=TypeScript&packages=axios%3Breact-icons%3Breact-router)

## ❗ Important
* The site generates a ZIP file. Just unzip it, `cd` to the folder (`cd my-project`), and run the command `npm i`. If you've successfully done this, you're good to go.  

* You can find the boilerplate-free templates [here]([./templates](https://github.com/0l1v3rr/react-initializr/tree/master/templates)). The site uses these as a base to generate your next project! ;)  
***Note: The template is a transformed [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) template.***
